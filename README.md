Welcome to the House Price Prediction repository! Here, you'll find all the files related to my internship task focused on predicting house prices using linear regression. The repository includes a dataset file containing relevant housing data and a PDF file showcasing the prediction program implemented in a Jupyter Notebook environment. With the dataset and prediction program readily available, you can delve into the world of machine learning-based price prediction and explore various aspects of linear regression models. Feel free to experiment, modify, and improve upon the existing work.
